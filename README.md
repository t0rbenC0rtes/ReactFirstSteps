# React First Steps

## Overview
React First Steps is a project that marks the beginning of my journey with React.js. This project explores key React concepts while implementing practical features like form validation, a persistent to-do list, and a stock management dashboard. It is built using Vite for a faster development experience and styled with Sass for modular and scalable CSS.

## Tech Stack
- **React.js**
- **Vite**
- **Sass**

## Project Goal
The primary goals of this project are to:
1. Learn the basics of React.js, including components, state, and props.
2. Build a persistent to-do list that leverages local storage.
3. Create a functional stock management dashboard with dynamic updates.
4. Practice form validation and user input handling.

## Features
- **Form Validation**: User-friendly forms with validation to ensure proper input.
- **Persistent To-Do List**: Tasks are saved using local storage, so they remain even after refreshing the page.
- **Stock Management Dashboard**: A simple yet effective interface to manage and track stock items dynamically.
- Modular and responsive styling powered by Sass.

## Notes
This project is a stepping stone for:
- Understanding the core concepts of React.js.
- Using Vite to enhance the development workflow.
- Developing modular and reusable components.
- Experimenting with state management and local storage in React.
